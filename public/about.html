<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am a first-year Morehead-Cain scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, majoring in Computer Science with minors in PPE and French.</p>

<p>I am deeply interested in technology and its current trajectory in our modern society. I'm always searching for opportunities to broaden my knowledge and skillset and delve further into the field. At UNC, I am heavily involved with Carolina's oldest a capella group, the UNC Clef Hangers. I'm a current publicity director and have previously served as the group's winter concert manager. </p>

<p>During my free time, I enjoy reading, running, creating or listening to music, and the great outdoors.Hello</p>
